TODO:

- bounding boxes to speed up cutting
- fix internal faces
- per pixel solution evaluation
- parallel solutions
- discontinuous solutions
- vector solutions (drawing magnitude, x, y, z)
- isosurface
- H(curl)/H(div) solutions
- tets

DONE: 

- fix Z fighting between mesh triangles and lines
- better buffer management
- fix mesh lines generation on cut the plane
- handle cut plane lines
- cut plane
